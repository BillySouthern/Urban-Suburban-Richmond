# Urban-Suburban-Richmond
Several ways of delineating the urban and suburban space in Richmond, VA. 

Seven scripts which reflect a different way of delineating the urban and suburban spatial extent of Richmond, Virignia.  

Each script includes code for the four most recent census years (1990 - 2020), using both Census and ACS data.

Units of observation include the Core-Based Statistical Area (the Metropolitan Statistical Area in this case of Richmond), the central cities/independant cities, and the census tract.  Spatial boundaries for 1990 and 2000 are first retrieved from NHGIS, while later units are sourced from TIGRIS/Tiycensus.

Newer delineations are obtained through spatial filtering while older delineations use relevant counties Counties. Predetermined objects require adjusting as necessary.  

See below maps the Political Units definition across all four years.
