# Urban-Suburban-Richmond
Several ways of delineating the urban and suburban space in Richmond, VA. 

Seven scripts which reflect a different way of delineating the urban and suburban spatial extent of Richmond, Virignia.  

Each script includes code for the four most recent census years (1990 - 2020), using both Census and ACS data.

Units of observation include the Core-Based Statistical Area (the Metropolitan Statistical Area in this case of Richmond), the central cities/independant cities, and the census tract.  Spatial boundaries for 1990 and 2000 are first retrieved from NHGIS, while later units are sourced from TIGRIS/Tiycensus.
